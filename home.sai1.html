       <h3>You Won't Believe What Happens to Dogs on the Iditarod Trail</h3>

        <p>The Iditarod dogsled race is an annual event during which human sled drivers, called "mushers" are pulled through the frigid Alaskan wilderness by a team of up to 16 dogs. The exact path they take, from Anchorage to the town of Nome, varies slightly from year to year, but the course length is unofficially listed as 1,049 miles-about the distance from Memphis, Tennessee, to New York City.</p>

        <p>This grueling race has proved deadly to dogs for many years. Dog deaths are so common during the race that Rule 42 of the official Iditarod rules blithely acknowledges that some dogs' deaths may be considered "unpreventable."" How then, in good conscience, in 2016, can an event known to cause animals to suffer and die be celebrated?</p>

        <h4>As the 2016 Iditarod approaches, it's important to remember the dogs who are injured and killed as well as disturbing facts about the race:</h4> 

        
         <ul id="ul">
            <li>At least 26 dogs used in the Iditarod have died just since 2004. Lat year, dogs Stiffy and Wyatt both died on the trail, and a dog named Stuart got loose and was later hit by a car.</li>
            <li>Countless dogs are injured. Last year, they included dogs used by musher Yuka Honda, who crashed into a sled and was then run over by another-and Laura, a 5-year-old dog who, according to news reports, was essentially "blind" and often seemed "confused" but was forced to race anyway by Kelly Maixner.</li>
            <li>Dogs used in the Iditarod are forced to run up to 100 miles a day through biting winds, blinding snowstorms, subzero temperatures, and treacherous ice. Even with snow booties on some, the dogs feet can become cut, bruised, and raw from the vast distances of frozen terrain that they cover.</li>
         </ul>
